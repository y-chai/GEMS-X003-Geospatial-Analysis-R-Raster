## **What is raster data?**

In its simplest form, a raster consists of a matrix of cells (or pixels) organized into rows and columns (or a grid) where each cell contains a value representing information, such as temperature, rainfall, elevation, etc.\
Rasters can be digital aerial photographs, imagery from satellites, digital pictures, or even scanned maps.

<img src="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/GUID-6754AF39-CDE9-4F9D-8C3A-D59D93059BDD-web.png"/>

### **Creating `SpatRaster` objects in R**

In this workshop, we will focus on using the `terra` package for raster data analysis. R package `terra` is designed to replace the old favourite `raster`. It is made by a similar team. The `terra` documentation states that `terra` "can do more, is simpler to use, and it is faster."

Raster data structure in R:

-   Number of rows

-   Number of columns

-   Bounding box (extent)

-   Resolution

-   Coordinate reference system (projection)

Create an empty `SpatRaster` object with 6 rows and 6 columns within bounding box (-1.5, 1.5, -1.5, 1.5)

```{r}
ras <- rast(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, xmin = -1.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = -1.5, ymax = 1.5)
ras
```

The objects `ras` created in the example above only consist of the raster 'geometry', that is, we have defined the number of rows and columns, and where the raster is located in geographic space, but there are no cell-values associated with it.

Setting and accessing values using the `values()` function

```{r}
# Assign known values to raster cells
ras_a <- ras
values(ras_a) <- 1:ncell(ras_a)

# Assign random values to raster cells
ras_b <- ras
set.seed(1234)
values(ras_b) <- runif(ncell(ras_b))*10

# plot two rasters
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(ras_a, main="Raster with values 1:36")
plot(ras_b, main="Raster with random values")

```

### Attributes

Raster cells can also have non-numerical values (attributes) assigned as factors with various levels.

```{r}
soil_order = c("clay", "silt", "sand")
set.seed(1234)
soil_char = sample(soil_order, 36, replace = TRUE)
soil_fact = factor(soil_char, levels = soil_order)
soil = rast(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, 
               xmin = -1.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = -1.5, ymax = 1.5,
               vals = soil_fact)
soil
plot(soil)
```

### Summarizing raster layer

```{r}
nrow(ras_a) # number of rows
```

```{r}
ncol(ras_a) # number of columns
```

```{r}
ncell(ras_a) # number of cells
```

```{r}
ext(ras_a) # raster extent
```

```{r}
res(ras_a) # resolution
```

```{r}
crs(ras_a) # coordiante reference system
```

```{r}
hist(ras_b)  # histogram of raster cell values
```

### Multi-layer raster

You can create a multi-layer `SpatRaster` object **with the same spatial extent and resolution** using the `c` method.

```{r}
r_stack = c(ras_a, ras_b, soil)
names(r_stack) = c("area", "prod" , "soil")
r_stack
```

```{r}
plot(r_stack)
```

### [**Exercise 1: Read in raster files and create raster stack**]{style="color:Green"}

In this exercise, we will first read in raster files (in `.tif` format) which contains the maize harvested area and production in Minnesota and then create a raster stack.

**Step 1:** Use the `rast()` function to read in raster files from the `"./data/MN/spam/"` directory.

> file `"./data/MN/spam/spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn.tif"` is the Harvested Area (in hectares) for Maize in Minnesota\
> file `"./data/MN/spam/spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn.tif"` is the Production (in metric tons) for Maize in Minnesota

Use various summarizing functions (e.g., `ext()`, `res()`, `crs()`) to check the two raster files having the same extent and resolution

```{r}

# Read in raster files
spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn <- rast("./data/MN/spam/spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn.tif")
spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn <- rast("./data/MN/spam/spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn.tif")

```

```{r}
# Check for extent, resolution, and crs

```

    # Possible Answer:
    # Check for extent, resolution, and crs
    ext(spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn)
    ext(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn)

    res(spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn)
    res(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn)

    crs(spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn)
    crs(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn)

**Step 2:** Use `c()` function to create a multi-layer raster with both area and production layers and rename the layers to "Area" and "Prod"

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Possible answer
    spam_MAIZ_A_mn <- c(spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn, spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn)

**Step 3:** Use `plot()` and `hist()` functions to explore your RasterStack

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Possible answer:
    plot(spam_MAIZ_A_mn)
    hist(spam_MAIZ_A_mn)

## **Raster Manipulation**

### Raster Subset

Raster subsetting is done with the base R operator `[  ]`

```{r}
# row 3, column 3
ras_a[3, 3]
# cell ID 15
ras_a[15]

```

Extracting all values or complete rows, you can use `values()`

```{r}
# all values
values(r_stack, mat=TRUE, dataframe=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# row 3-4
values(ras_a, mat=FALSE, dataframe=FALSE, row = 3, nrows = 2, col=1, ncols=2)

```

### Multi-layer Raster Subset

The `subset`, `[[ ]]` or `$` command extracts layers from a multi-layer raster.

```{r}
# Method 1
subset(r_stack, "area")
```

```{r}
# Method 2
r_stack[["area"]]
```

```{r}
# Method 3
r_stack$area

```

## **Spatial Operations**

Modifying raster objects based on their location and shape

### Map algebra

Map algebra makes raster processing really fast. This is because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates. If two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing. This is exactly what map algebra is doing in R.

Map algebra divides raster operations into four subclasses, with each working on one or several grids simultaneously:

1.  **Local** or per-cell operations
2.  **Focal** or neighborhood operations
3.  **Zonal** operations are similar to focal operations, but the surrounding pixel grid on which new values are computed can have irregular sizes and shapes
4.  **Global** or per-raster operations

#### **Local operations**

**Local** operations comprise all cell-by-cell operations in one or several layers.

Many generic functions that allow for simple and elegant raster algebra have been implemented for Raster objects, including the normal algebraic operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, logical operators such as `>`, `>=`, `<`, `==`, `!` and functions like `abs`, `round`, `ceiling`, `floor`, `trunc`, `sqrt`, `log`, `log10`, `exp`, `cos`, `sin`, `atan`, `tan`, `max`, `min`, `range`, `prod`, `sum`, `any`, `all`. In these functions you can mix raster objects with numbers, as long as the first argument is a raster object.

```{r}
area <- ras_a
areaX2 <- area*2
areaSq <- area^2

# Plot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(areaX2, main="Area Doubled")
plot(areaSq, main="Area Squared")

```

Summary functions (`min, max, mean, prod, sum, Median, cv, range, any, all`) always return a RasterLayer object. Perhaps this is not obvious when using functions like `min, sum or mean`.

```{r}
mean(areaX2, areaSq)
```

Raster algebra also allows logical operations such as finding all raster cells that are greater than a specific value.\
You can also use replacement functions to change values based on logical operations.

```{r}
area_cap <- area
area_cap[area_cap >= 25 ] <- 25

# Plot
plot(area_cap, main="Capped Area at 25")
```

Raster algebra can also be performed on two rasterlayers

```{r}
yield <- ras_b/ras_a
plot(yield)
```

#### **Focal operations**

**Focal** operations take into account a central cell and its neighbors.

The following code chunk applies an aggregation function to all cells within the specified neighborhood (in this case 3-by-3 cells), uses the corresponding output as the new value for the the central cell, and moves on to the next central cell:

<img src="images/focal_example.png" title="focal example" alt="focal example" width="600"/>

```{r}
area_focal_1 = focal(area, w = matrix(1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3), fun = min)
area_focal_2 = focal(area, w = matrix(1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3), fun = min, na.rm=TRUE, pad=T, fillvalue=NA)

# Plot
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(area, main="Area")
plot(area_focal_1, main="Area Focal Operation, w/o Padding")
plot(area_focal_2, main="Area Focal Operation, w Padding")
```

#### **Zonal operations**

**Zonal** operations are similar to focal operations, but the filter can take on any shape instead of a predefined rectangular window.

The following code chunk finds the mean area for each soil type:

```{r}
plot(soil)
```

```{r}
z <- zonal(area, soil, fun = "mean") 
z
```

#### **Global operations**

**Global** operations are a special case of zonal operations with the entire raster dataset representing a single zone.\
The most common global operations are descriptive statistics for the entire raster dataset such as the minimum or maximum.\
Use `global` if you want a single number summarizing the cell values of each layer.

```{r}
global(area, fun="max")
```

```{r}
global(area, fun='sd')
```

### [**Exercise 2: Map algebra**]{style="color:Green"}

In this exercise, we will practice map algebra using MN SPAM raster on maize harvested area and production.

**Step 1:** Create a raster called `spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn` which calculates the maize yield at each grid cell in MN using the Production raster `spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn` and Harvested Area raster `spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn`.

> Yield = Production / Harvested Area

Plot the maize yield raster map and look at the histogram for yield distribution.

```{r}
# Your code
```

    ## Possible answer:
    spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn <- spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn / spam_H_MAIZ_A_mn
    plot(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn)
    hist(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn)

**Step 2:** Use `focal()` function to create a RasterLayer which calcualtes the mean yield within 3x3 neighborhood grid cells. Then create a raster map that displays the difference between each grid cell's yield and "mean" yield of its neighborhood

```{r}
# Your code

```

    ## Possible answer:
    # focal calculation
    spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_focal <- focal(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn, w = matrix(1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3), fun = mean, na.rm=T, pad=T, padValue=NA)

    # plot the yield difference
    spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_diff <- spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn - spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_focal
    plot(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_diff)

**Step 3:** What's the maximum yield and what's the standard deviation for yield distribution in MN?

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Possible answer:
    global(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn, 'max', na.rm=T)
    global(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn, 'sd', na.rm=T)

## **Geometry operations**

Modifying geometric objects based on their geometry

### Trim and extend

`trim` crops a RasterLayer by removing the outer rows and columns that only contain NA values.\
In contrast, `extend` adds new rows and/or columns with NA values.\
The purpose of this could be to create a new RasterLayer with the same Extent of another, larger, RasterLayer such that they can be used together in other functions.

```{r}
area_1 <- area
ext(area_1)
```

```{r}
area_2 <- extend(area, c(1, 2)) 
ext(area_2)
```

```{r}
area_3 <- trim(area_2)
ext(area_3)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(area_1)
plot(area_2)
plot(area_3)
```

### Crop and Merge

The `crop` function lets you take a geographic subset of a larger raster object. You can crop a Raster by providing an extent object or another spatial object from which an extent can be extracted (objects from classes deriving from Raster and from Spatial in the `sp` package).

The `merge` function lets you merge 2 or more Raster objects into a single new object. The input objects must have the same resolution and origin (such that their cells neatly fit into a single larger raster).

```{r}
area_c1 = crop(area, ext(-1.5, 0.5, -0.5, 1.5))
area_c2 = crop(area, ext(-0.5, 1.5, -1.5, 0.5))
area_c1c2 = merge(area_c1, area_c2)
# Plots
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(area)
plot(area_c1)
plot(area_c2)
plot(area_c1c2)
```

### Aggregation & disaggregation

`aggregate` and `disagg` allow for changing the resolution (cell size) of a `SpatRaster` object. In the case of aggregate, you need to specify a function determining what to do with the grouped cell values. It is possible to specify different (dis)aggregation factors in the x and y direction. `aggregate` and `disagg` are the best functions when adjusting cells size only, with an integer step (e.g. each side 2 times smaller or larger).

```{r}
area_agg = aggregate(area, fact=2, fun=sum)

# quick plot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(area)
plot(area_agg)
```

To disaggregate a raster object you have to specify a method on how to fill the new cells.

-   **Nearest neighbor** (Default method, `method = "near"`): gives all output cells the value of the nearest input cell
-   **Bilinear interoploation** (`method = "bilinear"`): uses four nearest pixel centers of the input image to compute an average weighted by distance as the value of the output cell

Disaggregating is a simple interpolation technique

Corresponding values are only as accurate as their lower resolution source

```{r}
area_nb = disagg(area_agg, fact=2)
area_bi = disagg(area_agg, fact=2, method = "bilinear")

# plot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(area_nb)
plot(area_bi)
```

### Reclassify

You can use `classify` cell values to replace ranges of values with single values

```{r}
# classify with a 3-column classifying matrix specifying "from-to-becomes" , or a two-column matrix "is-becomes".
rcl = matrix(c(0, 12, 1, 12, 24, 2, 24, 36, 3), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
rcl
area_rcl = classify(area, rcl = rcl)
plot(area_rcl)
```

```{r}
# classify with a vector with "cuts"
breaks <- c(0, 12, 24, 36)
area_cut <- classify(area, breaks)
plot(area_cut)
```

### [**Exercise 3: Geometry operations**]{style="color:Green"}

In this exercise, we will practice geometry operations using MN SPAM raster on maize harvested area and production.

**Step 1:** Use `aggregate()` function to create a new RasterLayer from `spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn` which has a resolution that is 2x lower than the original (use mean value for the new aggregated raster cells).

Plot the aggregated maize yield raster map, check the number of cells in the new rasterlayer and look at the histogram for yield distribution, comparing your results with the original raster

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Possible answer:

    # Aggregate raster files
    spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg <- aggregate(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn, fact=2, fun=mean)

    # Plot map
    plot(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg)

    # Number of cells
    ncell(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg)
    ncell(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn)

    # Histogram
    hist(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg)
    hist(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn)

**Step 2:** Based on the yield distribution (histogram), use `classify()` function to create a RasterLayer which classifies the yield into "low", "mid", "high" groups. Choose your own breaks to do the grouping.

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Possible answer:

    # matrix method
    spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg_rcl = classify(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg, rcl =  matrix(c(0, 7, 1, 7, 10, 2, 10, 15, 3), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))
    plot(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg_rcl,  col = c('yellow', 'orange', 'dark green'))

    # cut method
    spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg_cut = classify(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg, rcl=c(0, 7, 10, 15), brackets=T)
    plot(spam_Y_MAIZ_A_mn_agg_cut,  col = c('yellow', 'orange', 'dark green'))

## **Raster-vector interactions**

### Cropping and masking

When the extent of input raster objects are larger than area of interest raster **cropping** and **masking** are useful for unifying the spatial extent of input data.

```{r}
# SpatialPolygons for cropping/masking 
px <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1) 
py <- c(1.5, 0, 0, -1, -1, 1.5) 
area_pol <- vect(cbind(px, py), "polygons")  # Convert to SpatVector
crs(area_pol) <- crs(area)

# plot
plot(area_pol)
```

```{r}
area_cropped <- crop(area, area_pol)
area_masked <- mask(area, area_pol)

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(area, main="Area")
plot(area_cropped, main="Area cropped")
plot(area_masked, main="Area masked")
```

## Raster extraction

Raster extraction is the process of identifying and returning the values associated with a 'target' raster at specific locations.

```{r}
# total area within selected shape
extract(area, area_pol, fun=sum, na.rm=T)
```

## Rasterization

Rasterization is the conversion of vector objects into their representation in raster objects.

The following code chunk rasterizes an input vector data using a template raster that has the same extent and CRS:

```{r}
area_pol_ras <- rasterize(area_pol, area)
area_pol_ras
plot(area_pol_ras)
```

### [**Exercise 4: Raster-vector interactions**]{style="color:Green"}

In this exercise, we will practice raster-vector interactions

**Step 1:** Read in MN ground water shapefile and select ground water provinces 1,2,3 to mask out maize production raster

-   Use `st_read()` function to read in the MN ground water shapefile from `./data/MN/gw_prov`
-   Plot the `PROVINCE` attribute using `tmap`.
-   Create a subset of ground water PROVINCE 1,2,3 shapefile
-   Notice the crs of the ground water shapefile is different from our maize SPAM raster, so first transform the crs to match our maize production raster
-   Use `mask` to mask out only maize production in ground water PROVINCE 1,2,3

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Read in MN ground water shapefile
    gw_prov <- st_read("./data/MN/gw_prov")
    summary(gw_prov)

    # Plot
    tm_shape(gw_prov) +
      tm_polygons("PROVINCE")

    # Subset PROVINCE 1, 2, 3
    gw_prov123 <- gw_prov[gw_prov$PROVINCE %in% c("1", "2", "3"), ]

    # mask
    # Transform CRS to match
    gw_prov123 <- st_transform(gw_prov123, crs=crs(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn))  
    # Convert to SpatVector
    gw_prov123 <- vect(gw_prov123)  
    spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn_mask <- mask(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn, gw_prov123)

    plot(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn_mask)

**Step 2:** Use `extract()` to calculate the total maize production within each of the MN water provinces 1, 2, 3

-   What's the dimension of the output from `extract()`? Why is that?

-   Add in the "PROVINCE" column to the output data.frame from `extract()`

-   Sum by "PROVINCE" to get the province-level total production

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Possible Answer:
    # extract()
    geom_sum <- extract(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn_mask, gw_prov123, fun=sum, na.rm=T)
    geom_sum

    # Province level total production
    geom_sum$PROVINCE <- gw_prov123$PROVINCE
    geom_sum <- as.data.table(geom_sum)
    geom_sum[, .(PROD_TOT = sum(spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn)), by=.(PROVINCE)]

**Step 3:** Use `rasterize()` to calculate the total maize production within MN water provinces 1, 2, 3

\- To use `rasterize()`, first need to convert province character to numeric `PROVINCE_CODE`, then rasterize on this field using either min or max function

\- Recall we can use `zonal()` function to aggregate one raster (i.e., production) based on another raster (i.e., provinces)

\- Compare your results with the `extract()` method

```{r}
# Your code

```

    # Possible answer:
    # rasterize()
    gw_prov123$PROVINCE_CODE <- as.numeric(gw_prov123$PROVINCE)
    gw_prov123_ras <- rasterize(gw_prov123, spam_P_MAIZ_A_mn_mask, field="PROVINCE_CODE", fun=min)
